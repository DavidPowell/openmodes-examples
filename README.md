# OpenModes examples

Example notebooks for the [OpenModes](http://davidpowell.github.io/OpenModes/) mode
solver for open electromagnetic resonators.
These files can be opened using the [IPython](http://ipython.org/), notebook,
an interactive web-based frontend to python.

You can view *non-interactive* output of the examples
[online](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/DavidPowell/openmodes-examples/tree/master/).
From this link, click on any of the examples (`*.ipynb`) and they will open as a web page.

To run the examples yourself

1. Ensure that you have successfully installed OpenModes as per the
   [installation instructions](http://www.pythonhosted.org/OpenModes/install.html)
2. Download the [zip file](https://github.com/DavidPowell/openmodes-examples/archive/master.zip)
   with all the examples and unzip them into a folder.
3. Open the IPython notebook. If you have installed python using the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads)
   distribution (the recommended way, especially on Windows), then the notebook should be available from the
   Launcher. Otherwise, open a command prompt and run `ipython notebook`
4. From the notebook file browser, navigate to the folder containing the examples and open one of the example notebooks
5. To re-run the whole example from the menu bar by select `Cell->Run All`. You should try modifying the examples
   with different parameters, and you only need to run cells again if you have changed something.
